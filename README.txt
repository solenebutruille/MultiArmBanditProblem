Every Algorithm is configure to run with parameters given : 
- 2000 bandits problems
- 1000 steps
- 10 arms. 

It will then display (depending on the chosen program) :
- Average reward   OR
- Percentage Optimal Action
In function on the number of steps. 

To have the algorithm with 1000 arm, it is possible to change the arm value in the code. 
It is the first parameter when call to function machine_learning.
